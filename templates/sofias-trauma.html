            trauma she experienced.

            If someone experiences a traumatic event and afterwards
            experiences unwanted thoughts, continues to relive what
            initially happened, feels disconnected from things that
            used to make them feel better or safe, and feels isolated
            or numb, name the type of stress disorder they may be
            experiencing.

                Unwanted thoughts, reliving the event, disconnection
                and numbness are all symptoms of PTSD. Someone
                experiencing this should seek help if they can. It is
                possible to recover and feel better.

                Someone experiencing these symptoms is not just in a
                bad mood or feeling down. Unwanted thoughts, reliving
                the event, disconnection and numbness are all symptoms
                of PTSD. Someone experiencing this should seek help if
                they can. It is possible to recover and feel better.

                stress experienced by someone with Post Traumatic
                Stress Disorder (PTSD). Someone experiencing this
                should seek help if they can. It is possible to

            <p>
                Extreme emotions: After a traumatic event, people
                often experience a wide range of emotional, physical
                and stress responses, often at the same time. Some
                reactions may appear totally unrelated but oftentimes
                can overwhelm our ability to cope emotionally and
                physically
            </p>
            <p>
                Difficulty sleeping: In response to a trauma, many may
                experience changes to their sleep pattern. They may
                have difficulty sleeping for long periods of time or
                may even withdraw and find it difficult to get up out
                of bed each morning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using drugs to try to cope and forget: After
                experiencing a traumatic event, many may start
                drinking or start using drugs as a way to try to deal
                with the extreme emotions they experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zoning out at work: A normal sign of trauma includes
                having uncontrollable thoughts and unintentionally
                distancing oneself from others and one’s surroundings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having constant memories of what happened: Many women
                who experience an extremely traumatic event may
                develop post-traumatic stress disorder, known as
                PTSD. One sign of PTSD involves having repeated
                unwanted thoughts or reexperiencing the initial
                traumatic event.
